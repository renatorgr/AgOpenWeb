/// <summary>
/// Contract fences around <see cref="FieldService"/>'s save/load behaviour
/// for boundaries. These exist because the project recently shipped a bug
/// where the user's painstakingly-recorded boundary was overwritten with
/// nothing on field-close: the boundary had been written to Boundary.txt
/// during recording, but ActiveField.Boundary in memory was null, so the
/// save-on-close cycle re-wrote the canonical (GeoJSON) file with no
/// boundary features. The next open round-tripped through the now-empty
/// GeoJSON and produced a field with no boundary.
///
/// What this fixture pins down:
///
///   1. A round-trip through FieldService preserves a 4-point boundary
///      in both legacy and GeoJSON formats.
///   2. After a save that wrote a boundary, loading it back yields an
///      identical boundary -- so anyone who refactors the canonical
///      load path (currently GeoJSON) into something that drops features
///      will see this go red.
///   3. The on-disk lat/lon line is locale-stable -- a separate-but-
///      related class of bug we have lost a day to before. Asserted with
///      CultureInfo.InvariantCulture so the test never reproduces the
///      bug it is fencing.
///
/// This fixture deliberately exercises the public IFieldService surface
/// (not the lower-level FieldPlaneFileService / BoundaryFileService),
/// because that is the surface the rest of the application actually
/// uses, and the contract the close-save bug crossed.
